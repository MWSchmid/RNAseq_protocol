From short reads to differential expression

I'm currently working on a workflow for RNA-Seq data analysis. It covers all steps from retrieval of sequences from SRA down to the differential expression analysis. It will be purely based on R and it looks like it will run on MacOSX, Linux and Windows. 

If (legally) possible, I will deposit it here somewhen in April 2016.
